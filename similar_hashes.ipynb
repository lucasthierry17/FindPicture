    "### What is Perceptual Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptual Hashing is a technique used to generate a hash value that represents the perceptual content of an image. These hashes are designed to be robust against minor modifications and variations in images, making it a useful technique for comparing images and finding similar ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does Perceptual Hashing Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Preprocessing**: The image is converted to grayscale and resized to a smaller, fixed size to normalize and simplify the content.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Various features are extracted from the image.\n",
    "3. **Hash Calculation**: These features are then used to calculate a hash value. The hashing algorithm is designed in such a way that similar images produce similar hash values. There are different hash algorithms; we are using the perceptual hashing algorithm.\n",
    "    - **3.1** The image is resized and applied to a discrete cosine transform (DCT).\n",
    "    - **3.2** The top-left 8x8 block of the DCT coefficients (excluding the DC coefficient) is selected.\n",
    "    - **3.3** The median value of these coefficients is calculated.\n",
    "    - **3.4** The hash is generated based on whether each coefficient is above or below the median.\n"
